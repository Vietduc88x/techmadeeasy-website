# AI blog

At Tech-Made-Easy, our mission is to make technology accessible to everyone. We believe that technology should be easy to understand and that everyone should have access to the tools they need to succeed in today’s digital world.

Our goal is to provide our readers with insightful and comprehensive content that simplifies the complexities of technology. We are committed to fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment that encourages discourse, learning, and growth. At Tech-Made-Easy, we strive to be a trusted source of information and a valuable resource for our readers.

At first, this blog will be more focus on the renewable energy sector including onshore wind and offshore wind. However, our aims will be more than that, we will expand to other technology sector including Artificial Intelligence, Open Web, Digital Twins as these are the furture of technologgy.

“Hey, have you heard about offshore wind energy? It’s basically using wind farms built in the ocean to generate electricity. They usually put them on the shallow continental shelf, but they’re starting to explore deeper waters too. It’s getting cheaper too, especially in the past three years. They’re even looking into floating wind turbines now, which is pretty cool. As the technology gets better and they start doing bigger projects, the costs should go down even more. Exciting stuff, right?”

We will discover together about the Offshore Wind farms, its components, technologies and supply chains.

before we get into the nitty-gritty of Crypto Network development, let’s take a closer look and see what it’s all about. So, what’s the deal with the number 3? Well, the Internet has gone through three different “generations”.

Web 1.0 was the first generation, from 1991 to 2004. Everything was pretty static and basic back then, with slow speeds and not much media. Most people were just browsing, and very few were creating content.

Web 2.0 is where we’re at now. Things got a lot more exciting and interactive, with social media and all sorts of services popping up. But it also brought some problems with it, like centralization, loss of privacy, and companies owning our digital assets.

Enter Crypto Network – the next generation. It’s all about decentralization, privacy, and shifting digital ownership from companies to decentralize networks, builders, users which help to further open up, the new network, open digital information and economy.

We will discover together on what is open webs, its usecase, potential investment.

“Yo, listen up! AI is like teaching computers to think and learn just like us using math and code. It’s this awesome program that takes in info, processes it, and gives us some super helpful output. It’s being used in all sorts of fields like coding, medicine, law, and art. AI is totally revolutionizing industries and we’re pretty sure it’s gonna be even bigger than the internet in the long run. In our blogs, we’ll be talking about different AI apps and tools that can help us get our work done faster and better.”
