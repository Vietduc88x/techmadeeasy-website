# WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE FOR OFFSHORE WIND FARM

**By Duc Hoang**

So, what is the Work Breakdown Structure? By PMBOK6 – PMI definition, The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS organizes and defines the total scope of the project and represents the work specified in the current approved project scope statement. The planned work is contained within the lowest level of WBS components, which are called work packages. A work package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated, monitored, and controlled. In the context of the WBS, work refers to work products or deliverables that are the result of activity and not to the activity itself.

Still feel a bit abstraction? put it more simply way:

**The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is like the blueprint for a project. Imagine it as a map that guides you through the project jungle.

Here’s what it does:

2.  **Top-Down Structure**: Just like starting from the big picture and zooming in, the WBS begins with the overall project scope. It’s like looking at the entire forest before focusing on individual trees.

4.  **Logical Segmentation**: Think of the WBS as a way to slice the project into manageable pieces. Each slice represents a specific task or component. It’s like cutting a pizza into neat wedges – easier to handle!

6.  **Inheritance**: The WBS shows how things are connected. It’s like a family tree for project tasks. When you complete one task, it affects others – just like how your cousin’s birthday party impacts your weekend plans.

8.  **Effective Management**: By dividing the project into smaller chunks, the WBS helps keep things organized. It’s like having separate folders for different parts of your school project – one for research, another for writing, and yet another for cat memes (because balance is essential).

So, next time you hear “WBS,” remember it’s your trusty project guide – helping you navigate the jungle, slice the pizza, and manage it all like a pro!

So, how is about the WBS of the Offshore Wind Farm looks like? There are many ways to present this depending you’re the contract and package strategies. If you recall the previous article mentioning about the interface between packages, I recommend to read this if you haven’t [https://techmadeeasy.info/matrix-of-responsibility-between-packages-for-offshore-wind/]()

One example of WBS for Offshore wind for reference:

Oh, holy …. Right! I know what do you feel, but this is one example and don’t worry. We will all go through each Work Package and will explain this into more detail of small WP in the many articles later. Let’s see at this stuff at level 2 in a way that won’t make your brain do somersaults.

**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** – sounds fancy, right? But it’s just our project roadmap. Imagine it as a treasure map with X marking the spots where we find answers and make things happen! Here’s the lowdown:

*   **Permits and Consents**: Think of this as getting permission slips for a school trip. To build our power plant, we need nods from the authorities. They’ll check if we’re playing by the rules and not causing any environmental mischief.

*   **Commercial Ventures**: Ah, the business side! Imagine we’re baking a cake (a wind farm cake, to be precise). We need to know where to sell our electricity slices and how to rake in the dough (cash, not flour). Equity and bank loans are like our secret ingredients.

*   **Measurement, Surveys, and Study**: Picture this: we’re detectives investigating the wind and ocean as well as the seabed and understand everying on the natural constraints and also unnatural constraint as well. We measure wind speed, wave patterns, and underwater secrets. Why? To predict how much energy our wind farm cake will bake! Plus, we peek at the seabed, what are the challengings, soil types and predition of ahead challengings, opportunities and risks– it’s like checking the cake pan before pouring the batter.

*   **Engineering Magic**: This is where the wizards (engineers) work their spells. They design the wind farm – its shape, size, and strength. Imagine building a LEGO tower that can withstand storms and time. And guess what? It’s not just about magic; it’s about saving coins too! We want our cake (I mean wind farm) to be cost-effective.

*   **Foundation Package**: Imagine our wind turbine as a ballet dancer – graceful, but it needs a sturdy stage to pirouette on. That’s where the foundation comes in! It’s like the dancer’s strong, invisible partner, ensuring stability. But wait, it’s not just about normal days; we’re talking superhero mode – ready for hurricanes, earthquakes, and other wild weather dances!

*   **Offshore Substation (OSS):** Picture this as the wind farm’s power hub. It’s like the heart of our energy system. Why? Because it pumps up the voltage! Think of it as an elevator – lifting electricity from medium voltage to high voltage. Why? So our energy can travel long distances without losing its mojo. But here’s the twist: OSS isn’t always invited to the wind farm party. Sometimes it’s like that extra topping on your pizza – nice to have, but not essential. It all boils down to economics – the cost-benefit salsa!

*   **Cables**: Imagine our wind turbines as a bunch of friends at a party. They need to chat and share secrets, right? Well, these interarray cables connect them – like a web of whispers. And guess what? They don’t stop there! These cables shimmy back to the shore via export cables. It’s like our turbines sending postcards home.

*   **HV Substation and Transmission**: Picture this as our wind farm’s grand junction box. It’s where the magic happens! When our export cables reach the shore, they high-five the HV substation. Why? Because it’s the gateway to the Grid – the electricity highway. We’re not just baking cake (remember the wind farm cake?). We’re selling slices! The HV substation also moonlights as an electricity quality inspector and regulator. It checks and regulate for harmonies, voltages, and other fancy stuff. Think of it as the cake tester and corrector – ensuring our slices meet the Grid’s gourmet standards.

*   **Wind Turbine Generator (WTG):** Ta-da! The star of our show – the wind turbine generator! It’s like a graceful dancer pirouetting in the breeze. But wait, it’s no ordinary twirl. It captures wind’s kinetic energy, spins its blades, and voilà – electricity! But here’s the plot twist: it’s not a simple jig. It’s a high-tech tango with power electronics, generators, and futuristic moves. Our mission? To ensure we have enough turbines for our wind farm dance party!

*   **T&I Package (Transport & Installation):** Picture this as our turbine’s grand voyage to the ocean ballroom. But wait, it’s no ordinary cruise – we’re talking heavy-lift vessels, the VIPs of the sea. These vessels are like cranes on steroids, lifting turbine components and pirouetting them into place. But here’s the twist: they’re rare gems, like unicorns at a rental shop. Even if you have a treasure chest of gold, they might not be available. The T&I package choreographs this dance – transporting turbine parts from the marshalling port (our backstage) to the offshore stage (the big show). It’s high-risk, like tightrope walking during a storm. But with good planning, weather forecasts, and ocean data (remember our detective work?), we’ll nail it!

*   **Marshalling, Fabrication Ports, and Services**: Fancy names, right? But let’s peek behind the velvet curtain. The marshalling port isn’t a red carpet event; it’s where we stash our giant puzzle pieces. Imagine unloading massive components – foundations, turbine parts – from manufacturer ships. These pieces are hefty, like elephants doing ballet. And...2165 bytes truncated...
