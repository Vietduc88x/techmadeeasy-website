# The world of symmetric risk versus the power of asymmetric risk

As I mentioned in a previous article, I'm a firm believer that "the biggest risk is not taking any risk at all." You can read more of my initial story [here](https://techmadeeasy.info/blog/my-story-told-again).

**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. My posts are based on my own self-learnings and many years dying through brutal markets. Nothing written here is investment advice, and I don't offer any training or get anything from you guys. This is for informational purposes only. If you find it useful, good for you. If not, then, that's it, man.

Some people say, "high risk, high reward." In my opinion, this can be true, but it can also be very untrue. And why? Let's talk about two types of risk: symmetric and asymmetric.

## The World of Symmetric Risk

Let me break down what symmetric risk looks like in the real world. Let's talk about a standalone project, like a Solar Power Plant. This is a classic example of a symmetric risk investment.

On one hand, it's a predictable path. You can do a lot of calculations to figure out your potential return. You'll run PVsyst calculations, buy the solar irradiation data, factor in the system design and potential power losses, estimation of grid curtailment and map out the timeline to the Commercial Operation Date. You know the plant has a typical lifetime of 20-25 years, and you can calculate the expected returns (the IRR) pretty accurately. The potential for profit is balanced by the potential for loss—it's all proportional.

But to get to that predictable return, you have to manage a whole world of risks. The power plant might be an independent asset, but its success is tied to many factors. There are technological risks (solar modules, inverters, system integration, downtime, power transformers), financing and currency risks, and even country-level political risks. You have to secure all the right permits and land rights. You have to account for civil engineering challenges and natural disasters like floods or typhoons. And you're counting on your contractors to perform during construction.

So, does taking higher risk always mean higher reward here? Not necessarily. For example, if you take a high risk to invest in a project with low solar irradiation or challenging site conditions, the reward might still be very low. The key to high rewards in this type of system is expertise and experience. That's why investors are willing to hire entire teams—technical advisors, legal advisors, project managers—to manage the whole project lifecycle. This is why these projects require professional and experienced developers, and it's where a platform like LinkedIn comes in. It's the ecosystem that connects all of us, the professionals who navigate these complex risks to bring these projects to life. It's a big part of why we're all here.

And at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. These plants are powering the fundamental needs of our communities, and that's a contribution we can all be proud of. In this symmetric risk system, most of us (like you and me, the staff) play a role in an organization based on our expertise. We trade our time and knowledge to fulfill our roles.

In this system, any mistake can be very costly, so it is extremely risk-averse. Every investment is verified carefully throughout the project's life. If a major risk or a new negative finding occurs, the project might be killed at a decision gate. If you manage a project and it has to be killed, don't be sad and don't take it personally. This is just part of the process to defend the investment capital.

## The Power of Asymmetric Risk

This is where things get interesting. Asymmetric risk is when the potential upside is so much greater than the potential downside. It's about being bold, thinking outside the box, and seeing opportunities that others might miss.

We can see real-world examples in companies like Tesla, Google, or Microsoft which were the asymmetric opportunities in our recent period (noted: it may now become symmetric risk - I don't know, just guess). When they started, they were taking big risks, but the potential reward wasn't just a few percentage points—it was the chance to change the world and create incredible wealth. The same goes for things like financial network like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the recent AI boom that has propelled as incredible name like NVIDIA recently.

Let's take a closer look at Tesla. We can ignore the very early days after the IPO, but there was a huge opportunity in 2019. The stock went from around $15 per share to $400 in just three years—a 26x return. By then, Tesla cars were well-known. There's that funny story you hear: people saying they'd be millionaires if they had bought Tesla stock instead of the car. It's a mind-blowing idea, and it shows what's possible if you dare to think differently.

Or even Google, 6x in 6 years, Amazon 4x in 3 years (2019: $60 -> 2025: $250)

Of course, for every company that rises magnificently, others fall from the top, like Nokia and Yahoo. So, what's the secret?

From my perspective, it comes down to the power of **Networks, Platforms, and Attention**.

**Network Effects:** The biggest jumps happen when a company builds a moat and dominates a network. In Google's case, it's the search engine. The Winner take most!

With Tesla, they didn't just build a car; they built an autonomous network of cars. Even financial assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum can be seen as financial networks.

**Hardware Layers:** NVIDIA is a special case. They are building the essential hardware layer for the entire AI boom. I have to admit, I regret missing this opportunity even this is in front me everyday, but it's a lesson learned for next time.

**The Attention Economy:** This is an important part I didn't understand until I saw the GameStop phenomenon. A stock can skyrocket simply because it goes viral on the internet. I now believe this is a consequence of capital flowing seamlessly between financial network versus social network which could be called the "attention economy." Suddenly, attention itself becomes a valuable asset. Understanding this might increase your chance of catching a skyrocketing stock. I think NVIDIA was able to capture the whole attention economy (not just their revenue) thanks to the emergence of ChatGPT and hype, speculation around AI.

## Why Does This Matter?

I've caught a few of these asymmetric opportunities myself. I've also missed some and, yes, I've had losses. But when you get it right, the rewards can be much higher than the losses. Of course, it's fun when you catch one (and even better if you can hold on after it skyrockets!), and it's sad when you lose money.

For asymmetric opportunities, financial reports might give you some insight, but honestly, that's not where the real story is. You need to see beyond the numbers.

In fact, finding these opportunities can be hard, or it can be easy—it all depends on your perspective and your openness to new ideas, which has nothing to do with how intelligent you are. Sometimes, an opportunity is right in front of your eyes every day, but you just don't see it (like my miss with NVIDIA).

It can be scary at first, thinking about losing your capital if things don't go well. Your investment strategy and how you manage your funds are key. But I believe the most important thing is our mental model—how we see and understand exponential growth, which is something I wrote about in my blog post on [The Power of Compounding](https://techmadeeasy.info/blog/the-power-of-compounding). And of course, you have to be able to tell the difference between a real deal and the get-rich-quick scams that are everywhere these days. One of the most important pieces are about to manage your emotions and expectation which are very important for the investment activities, heading to [https://mentalhub.techmadeeasy.info/](https://mentalhub.techmadeeasy.info/) for better information.

Asymmetric opportunities aren't just in investing. You can find them in marketing, creating video content, writing blog posts, coding, or learning something new. It's not that they're rare; it's about how we view and approach them. Think about this article. It might cost me a few hours to write. In the worst-case scenario, it's a useless post that no one reads (and I think there's a high chance of that!). However, it's also possible that some of you might find an insight here that brings value to your own perspective.

## So, What does it mean?

Symmetric opportunities can give us stability—paying the bills, our employee work life-balance, and your life meanings, your company network, your colleagues, supporting our communities which are important factors of our life. However, asymmetric risks are first it is very wild where you can make a real impact for yourself. It's about being very bold, and sometimes feeling the solitude of being different. It's about doing your self homework and being brave enough to take a chance on something you believe in. It's about finding those opportunities where the potential for growth is so much bigger than the fear of failure. It rewards you for being right and slash you for being "Not right".

In the end, both risk systems are very useful. I have had the chance to live in both, sometimes are very fun but sometime are not really fun. Tell me your story, friends!
