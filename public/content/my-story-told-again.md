# My Story, Told Again - Once look back, see how far you've come!

A new year is a time for reflection, and I have a story to tell.

I remember a time when I was a young, broke engineer. I had almost nothing except for a Honda motorbike my father gave me, a foldable table, and a few books. My salary was about $100 a month, but the company only paid me half of that every two months, keeping the rest as "borrowed money." So, I was living on just $50 a month. It's still hard to believe I managed to live well and stay happy on so little.

I'm sure that students and engineers today are much better off than I was. The best thing I had back then was my Honda. I still have and use it, and it reminds me every day of how far I've come. It's been more than a friend; it's been like a faithful horse that has been with me for so long.

Living in a small town in Vietnam, I made a bold decision to enroll in a master's course in Renewable Energy. At the time, nobody knew what that was. My friends laughed at me, asking why I would join such a "useless" course. But I resigned from my low-paying engineering job and jumped into this new field.

The strange thing was, my English was not very good, which was a common problem for Vietnamese students and young engineers back then. To be honest, I didn't have much, but I had a dream that I could do something better with my life.

After a few awkward English interviews, I was accepted into the program. I'm still not sure why. Maybe it was because the course was new, or perhaps they felt sorry for a poor guy like me. Either way, I was in.

And so, with my limited English, I found myself struggling to understand complex technical subjects like mechanics, thermodynamics, and power electronics. It was a disaster at first. I was a civil engineer learning about things my brain couldn't grasp. The only course I truly enjoyed was a 3D modeling class where I could create simulations. That was exciting.

As time went on, I slowly began to understand, even the basics of electricity. I went back to old physics books and relearned everything I had forgotten. English was still a headache, especially with French professors whose accents were sometimes hard to follow. But I kept learning, seriously and continuously.

Time flies. Looking back, I know I've come a long way. It wasn't a perfect journey, and there were many ups and downs. There were moments of sadness, for sure. Compared to many others, I may not seem like much, but when I look at my own progress from where I started, I know it's been a long and meaningful journey.

I was never an honor student. I never got excellent grades or went to an expensive international school. My path was never easy. I believe what brought me here was being humble, continuously learning, and always doing my best.

Alongside my career in renewable energy, I also started exploring the world of investing and trading. It was completely outside my comfort zone, but I gave it a shot anyway—learning as I went and trying new things, much like I do with my blog. (You can check it out at https://techmadeeasy.info/ - I know, it might seem a bit random, but it's worth a look!) I've always been a believer in the saying, "The biggest risk is not taking any risk at all."

That's my story, my friends. For the young engineers and students today, I believe you are much better off and better educated than I ever was. I probably shouldn't give advice, but if I did, it would be this: just keep learning and keep doing. You may make a mistake, or look odds, stupid sometimes. However, once look back, see how far you've come.
